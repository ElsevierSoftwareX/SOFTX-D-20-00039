`genieclust`: Fast and Robust Hierarchical Clustering with Noise Point Detection
================================================================================

    **Genie outputs meaningful clusters and is fast even for large data sets.**

    -- by `Marek Gagolewski <https://www.gagolewski.com/>`_


A faster and more powerful version of **Genie** - a robust and outlier resistant
clustering algorithm, originally published as an R package
`genie <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/genie/>`_.

The Genie algorithm [1]_ is based on a minimum spanning tree (MST) of the
pairwise distance graph of an input point set.
Just like the single linkage, it consumes the edges
of the MST in increasing order of weights. However, it **prevents
the formation of clusters of highly imbalanced sizes**; once the Gini index
of the cluster size distribution raises above an assumed threshold,
a point group of the smallest size is forced to merge with its nearest
neighbouring cluster.

Genie's appealing simplicity goes hand in hand with its usability;
it **often outperforms other clustering approaches**
such as K-means, BIRCH, or average, Ward, and complete linkage
on `benchmark data <https://github.com/gagolews/clustering_benchmarks_v1/>`_.

Genie is also **very fast** â€” determining the whole cluster hierarchy
for datasets of 10M points in low dimensional Euclidean spaces or
100K points in high dimensional ones takes 1-2 minutes.
There's also an approximate version, based on `nmslib` [3]_, that
is even faster and supports, amongst others, sparse or string inputs.
Therefore, it is perfectly suited for solving of **extreme clustering tasks**
(large datasets with any number of clusters to detect) for data
that fit into memory.

It also allows clustering with respect to mutual reachability distances
so that it can act as a **noise point detector** or a
robustified version of `HDBSCAN\*` [2]_ that is able to detect a predefined
number of clusters and hence it doesn't dependent on the `DBSCAN`'s somehow
difficult-to-set `eps` parameter.



The Python language version of `genieclust` has
a familiar `scikit-learn`-like look-and-feel:

.. code-block:: python

    import genieclust
    X = ... # some data
    g = genieclust.Genie(n_clusters=2)
    labels = g.fit_predict(X)


R's interface is compatible with ``hclust()``, but there is more.

.. code-block:: r

    X <- ... # some data
    h <- gclust(X)
    plot(h) # plot cluster dendrogram
    cutree(h, k=2)
    # or genie(X, k=2)


The `genieclust` package is available for Python (**TODO**: PyPI--link, how to install)
and R (**TODO**: CRAN--link, how to install). Its source code is distributed
under the open source GNU AGPL v3 license and can be downloaded from
`https://github.com/gagolews/genieclust <https://github.com/gagolews/genieclust>`_.
Note that the core functionality is implemented in form of a header-only C++
library, hence it might be relatively easily adapted for use in other
environments.
