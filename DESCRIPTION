Description: A reimplementation of the Genie algorithm - a robust
    hierarchical clustering method
    (Gagolewski, Bartoszuk, Cena, 2016 <DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2016.05.003>).
    Now faster and more memory efficient; determining the whole hierarchy
    for datasets of 10M points in low dimensional Euclidean spaces or
    100K points in high dimensional ones takes 1-2 minutes.
    Allows clustering with respect to mutual reachability distances
    so that it can act as a noise point detector or a robustified version of
    HDBSCAN* (that is able to detect a predefined number of
    clusters and hence it does not dependent on the DBSCAN's somehow
    fragile `eps` parameter).
    The package also features an implementation of economic inequity indices
    (the Gini, Bonferroni index) and external cluster validity measures
    (partition similarity scores; e.g., the adjusted Rand, Fowlkes-Mallows,
    adjusted mutual information, pair sets index).
